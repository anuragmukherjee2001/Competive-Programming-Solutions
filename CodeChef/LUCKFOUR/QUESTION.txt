Kostya likes the number 4 much. Of course! This number has such a lot of properties, like:

    1) Four is the smallest composite number;
    2) It is also the smallest Smith number;
    3) The smallest non-cyclic group has four elements;
    4) Four is the maximal degree of the equation that can be solved in radicals;
    5) There is four-color theorem that states that any map can be colored in no more than four colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions are colored in the same color;
    6) Lagrange's four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four square numbers;
    7) Four is the maximum number of dimensions of a real division algebra;
    8) In bases 6 and 12, 4 is a 1-automorphic number;
    9) And there are a lot more cool stuff about this number!

Impressed by the power of this number, Kostya has begun to look for occurrences of four anywhere.
He has a list of T integers, for each of them he wants to calculate the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the decimal representation.
He is too busy now, so please help him.

Input

The first line of input consists of a single integer T, denoting the number of integers in Kostya's list.

Then, there are T lines, each of them contain a single integer from the list.


Output

Output T lines. Each of these lines should contain the number of occurences of the digit 4 in the respective integer from Kostya's list.


Constraints

    1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
    (Subtask 1): 0 ≤ Numbers from the list ≤ 9 - 33 points.
    (Subtask 2): 0 ≤ Numbers from the list ≤ 10^9 - 67 points.
